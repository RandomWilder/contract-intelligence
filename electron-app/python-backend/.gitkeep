# This file ensures the python-backend directory is preserved in git
# The directory structure is needed for the application to store:
# - google_credentials.json (OAuth client credentials)
# - google_token.pickle (OAuth tokens after authentication)
# - app_settings.json (application configuration)
# 
# These files are ignored by .gitignore for security but the directory must exist
